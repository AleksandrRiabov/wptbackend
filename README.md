 #  The WPT (Warehouse Planning Tool)
The WPT is a back-end repository for a MERN stack application that I am currently developing. This application is designed to help warehouses plan the number of trailers required to dispatch orders efficiently. The application utilizes AI to predict future orders based on past data, enabling warehouses to plan ahead and allocate resources more effectively.

The application is being built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and Node.js. The back-end is being developed using Node.js and ExpressJS, while the front-end is being developed using ReactJS. MongoDB is being used as the database for the application.

The WPT will allow users to view the status of their orders and plan for the number of trailers required to dispatch them, which will help them allocate resources efficiently. The AI component of the application will use machine learning algorithms to analyze past data and predict future orders, giving users valuable insights into their order planning.
## Please note that this is a work in progress and the application is not yet ready for use. This repository contains the code for the back-end logic of the application.
