# WPT - Warehouse Planning Tool (Back-end)

WPT Backend serves as the backbone for the Warehouse Planning Tool, providing the necessary APIs and data management functionalities to support the frontend application. This repository contains the server code built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with Mongoose for database interaction. Firebase is used for authentication, ensuring secure access to the application.

## Key Technologies

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows you to execute server-side JavaScript.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing and managing application data.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a more structured way to interact with the database.
- **date-fns**: A modern JavaScript date utility library used for handling date and time operations.
- **Firebase Authentication**: A secure authentication method that integrates with Firebase to manage user access and authentication.
